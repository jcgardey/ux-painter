## UX-Painter

UX-Painter is a web-extension that enables the creation of alternative versions of a web application by applying any combination of predefined Client-Side Web Refactorings (CSWRs). These refactorings are predefined UI transformations that intend to quickly solve user interaction problems without altering the codebase.
